# Maven Market â€“ Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is a professional **Power BI dashboard** built from the Maven Market dataset.  
It simulates a real-life business case where a retail company needs to **monitor sales performance, customer behavior, and operational KPIs** across multiple countries and product categories.  

The goal is to provide a **user-friendly, interactive tool** for executives and analysts to quickly identify trends, compare regions, and track progress against business objectives.
